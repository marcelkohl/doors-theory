## Purpose
This utility tries to practically prove the theory of
doors presented by teacher Carla Morschbacher in the classroom.

## The problem
In a TV show, is presented a test consisting of 3 closed doors, being that in one of them there is a prize and in the other two has nothing. The purpose of the test is to try to choose the door that has the prize.

**Result:** The possibility of hitting a door in 3 it averages 33%, with a few variations.

In door theory, the suggestion is that before open the door chosen by the guest, the
presenter open a door that has no prize.

## Question
Now, with a port already chosen, and a invalid port already open, if guest changes door the chances of him winning are the same or are different?

Teacher Carla said the chances were bigger if the guest changed the door, and I doubted of this, so I made this app to prove if there were actually more chances. She was right.

## Compiling and Running
This project is done using OOP Pascal and can be fully compiled using [Lazarus](https://www.lazarus-ide.org/) open source tool or Delphi.
